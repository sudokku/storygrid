# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** A user can build a multi-cell photo collage from scratch, fill it with images, and download a pixel-perfect 1080×1920px PNG — entirely in the browser, no account or server required.
**Current focus:** Phase 00 — project-scaffolding

## Current Position

Phase: 00 (project-scaffolding) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 1
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: mediaId/mediaRegistry split designed into Phase 1 — data URIs never enter undo history snapshots
- [Roadmap]: Divider drag uses raw pointer events (setPointerCapture), NOT dnd-kit — avoids full-tree re-renders on pointermove
- [Roadmap]: ExportSurface always mounted (visibility:hidden), never conditionally rendered — prevents blank-PNG race
- [Roadmap]: All images converted to base64 at upload time (Phase 3) — prerequisite for correct Phase 4 exports
- [Roadmap]: COOP/COEP headers deferred to Phase 6 only — enabling earlier breaks third-party sub-resources
- [Roadmap]: Pan/zoom promoted from Phase 7 to Phase 5 (research finding: table-stakes for portrait photos in landscape cells)
- [Roadmap]: Cell-swap-by-drag added to Phase 5 (research finding: expected by users; low effort with existing dnd-kit infrastructure)
- [Phase 00-project-scaffolding]: React pinned to 18.3.1 (Vite scaffold generates React 19; explicitly downgraded per CLAUDE.md)
- [Phase 00-project-scaffolding]: @dnd-kit/sortable installed at v10.0.0 (not v6.3.1 in CLAUDE.md) — current published major; peer dep @dnd-kit/core ^6.3.0 is compatible
- [Phase 00-project-scaffolding]: All Editor layout uses Tailwind utility classes only (no inline style) — enables Phase 5 dark theme swap without restructuring

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 warrants /gsd:research-phase before planning — SharedArrayBuffer + COOP/COEP + ffmpeg xstack are complex integrations
- Phase 7 save/load: validate Zustand v5 persist middleware behavior change (initial state no longer stored at creation) before building
